                Imagine a scale. At the higher end of it, you have languages that are very easy for humans to comprehend. At the lower end, you have languages that are easy for the computer to understand. That is how the disctinction between high and low level languages can be summed up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python for example, is a high-level language. Since it is very close to english, it is easy for us to read and write. Assembly languages, on the other hand, are very low level, since they are directly translated to binary code.
            </p>
            <p>
                High-level languages allow humans to save time when writing code, but the program then takes longer for the computer to execute. Like with everything in life, it's all about trade-offs.
